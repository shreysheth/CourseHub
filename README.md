**CourseHub: Empowering Educators, Equipping Learners**

**Project Overview**

CourseHub is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between educators and learners. It offers a streamlined platform for teachers to upload and manage their courses, while allowing students to discover, enroll, and access enriching educational content.

**Key Features**

* **Course Management System (CMS) for Teachers:**
    * Intuitive Angular UI for effortless course creation and management.
    * Upload various course materials, including videos, documents, presentations, and more.
    * Structure courses with modules and lessons for organized learning.
    * Set access permissions and manage student enrollment.
* **Learning Management System (LMS) for Students:**
    * User-friendly interface for course discovery and enrollment.
    * Access a diverse range of courses from various educators.
    * Progress through course modules at their own pace.
    * Track learning progress and achievements.
* **Robust Backend (ASP.NET Core and SQL Server):**
    * Secure and scalable infrastructure to handle growing user base and course content.
    * Efficient data management using SQL Server for a seamless user experience.
    * RESTful API for potential integrations with mobile apps or other platforms (future development).

**Technologies Used**

* Frontend: Angular (for a dynamic and interactive user interface)
* Backend: ASP.NET Core (for robust server-side logic and API development)
* Database: SQL Server (for efficient data storage and retrieval)

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
    * A code editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, WebStorm).
    * Basic understanding of Angular, ASP.NET Core, and SQL Server concepts.
